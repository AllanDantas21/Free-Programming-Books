# Free-Programming-Books

### These are the programming books which I've collected for about two years now. Hmm...that's not the point. I just want to inform you that if you need any programming book, then you can download that from here for personal use. The provided books are high quality and mostly recommended by top programmers. That's why I think that these books can make quite a big difference in learning programming for the poor or deprived students who doesn't have enough money to buy them (also note that I didn't buy all of them. These books were distributed by the users themselves.) but has enough courage and perseverance to acquuire them. Oh man! I got emotional. Anyway, good luck and happy coding!

### Also note that there are some books which were more than 25 megabytes. That's why I can't upload them to github but you still can find them in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EUYZzD00jYvfack2fuSoCAqqe0CyrmnV?usp=sharing).
